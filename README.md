### Introduction.

This document exhibits the dynamic of coding and applying static analysis for quality assurance on traditional
computational problems.
The process of building a valid deliverable is described in the next main steps:

1.	Understanding three problems and their specific requirements.
2.	Installation of the support libraries to prepare the environment, especially Pylint.
3.	Coding the solution one by one.
4.	Initial testing for preparing the environment.
5.	Testing using the Pylint static analysis tool under the PEP 8 standards.
6.	Fixing inconsistencies and bugs.
7.	Assessing the three solutions by using a battery of tests prepared in advance.

### Products deliverables.
The following deliverables are the main parts of the final solution.
