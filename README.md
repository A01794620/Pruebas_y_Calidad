### Introduction.

This document exhibits the dynamic of coding and applying static analysis for quality assurance on traditional
computational problems.
The process of building a valid deliverable is described in the next main steps:

1.	Understanding three problems and their specific requirements.
2.	Installation of the support libraries to prepare the environment, especially Pylint.
3.	Coding the solution one by one.
4.	Initial testing for preparing the environment.
5.	Testing using the Pylint static analysis tool under the PEP 8 standards.
6.	Fixing inconsistencies and bugs.
7.	Assessing the three solutions by using a battery of tests prepared in advance.

### Products deliverables.
The following deliverables are the main parts of the final solution.

List of programs for the Programming Individual Exercise: 4.2.1.

* **Program #1. Computing Statistics:**: an applicative that returns basic statistics from prefilled population. 
                The algorithms used only language primitives and were built from scratch.
                The statistical algorithms were methodologically based on the material of 
                Bruce, Bruce & Gedeck (2022, pp. 8-15).

* **Program #2. Number Base Converter:**: an applicative that converts long decimal numbers into their hexadecimal  
                and binary representations.
                The number conversions algorithms were methodologically based on the material of
                Morris & Ciletti (2013, pp. 6-11).

* **Program #3. Word Counting**: a program which takes a list of prefilled words and counts the coincidences of
                each of them. Finally return the list on descending order.
